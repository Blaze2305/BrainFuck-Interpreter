# BrainFuck Interpreter

Just another brainfuck interpreter written in C++17. It also lets you know if your script has some issue with the bracket ( \[   \] )  loops.

### Run :
- Build the compiled source of the project
    ```bash
    $ make build
    ```
 
    Build outputs to a folder named bin with the executable named brain.
    
- Run the code with
    ```bash
    $ brain.exe path/to/input/file
    ```
    
    Remember to end the console input with an EOF ( ctrl D  on Linux and ctrl Z on windows.).
